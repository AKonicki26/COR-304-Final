### “No Sub, No Save”: Protest Erupts After Local Resident Dies Following Trauma Team Refusal

__WORCESTER, MA__ – Hundreds gathered outside the Union Station Trauma Team depot last night after reports 
that __Janelle Ruiz__, a 33-year-old resident of Main South, died in her apartment after being 
__denied emergency medical assistance__ by Trauma Team International due to __lack of subscription coverage__.

According to eyewitnesses and security footage shared online, Ruiz suffered a critical reaction to a cyberware 
rejection flare-up. Neighbors attempted to stabilize her while placing emergency calls, but no authorized responders 
arrived until __over 40 minutes later__—well past the critical window. By then, she had succumbed to her injuries.

Trauma Team issued a formal statement this morning, reiterating that __non-subscribers are not eligible__ for 
dispatch and that “protocol was followed without deviation.”

> “We’re not asking for miracles,” said protest organizer __Amira Sanchez__, shouting through an old-world bullhorn. 
> “We’re asking for *basic care*. No one should die just because they can’t afford a subscription.”

The crowd—largely composed of Main South residents, med-tech students from WIT, and community activists—held signs 
reading “__No Sub, No Save = No Soul__” and “__We Are Not Clients. We Are People.__” Police drones hovered overhead, 
though no violence was reported as of press time.

City Councilor __Luis Mendoza__ has called for a formal review of Worcester’s public health infrastructure and 
questioned the city’s continued tax subsidies for Trauma Team operations.

> “If they won’t respond to our people, why are they being funded by our taxes?” Mendoza stated on the floor of City Hall.

Trauma Team declined further comment.

As Worcester continues to straddle the line between corporate control and community survival, 
the death of Janelle Ruiz has reignited a long-simmering debate: __Is healthcare a right—or just another subscription service?__
