# Housing

In the world of Cyberpunk, housing reflects a personâ€™s social class, corporate affiliation, and access to technology. 
Worcester, being a city divided by income and influence, shows a clear contrast in housing quality between the
north and south ends of the city.

In the northern sections of the city, corporate owned housing and large apartment skyscrapers house the wealthier 
elite of the city. 
These buildings are often guarded, climate-controlled, and feature internal smart systems.
Access to these homes is generally restricted to mid-to-high ranking corporate employees, researchers.

In the southern districts, especially around Main South and Kelley Square, are filled with overcrowded megablocks, 
converted warehouses, and abandoned industrial spaces that have been turned into makeshift housing. 
Many of these buildings lack basic utilities, and are often controlled by local gangs or community defense groups. 
Security is self-managed, and break-ins are common.

Homelessness remains a major issue, with tent zones and stacked container housing being common throughout the city. 
Some nomadic groups set up temporary settlements on the outskirts of the city, 
where they rely on salvaged technology and communal living arrangements.

As corporate real estate interests expand, student housing around the WIT campus grows sparse, increasing the 
student need for illegal cyberware installations performed by students. Many students will live in compact housing
if they are not given housing opportunities by a corporate entity for academic merit.

While legal protections for tenants technically still exist in the New United States, enforcement in 
Worcester is minimal, especially in the southern zones. Housing remains a privilege tied to wealth, employment, 
or alignment with a larger power structure.
