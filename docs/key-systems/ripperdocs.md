# Ripperdocs

In the world of Cyberpunk, a Ripperdoc is a medical technician that serves between an overlap between surgeon, body
artists, and mechanical engineers. They use surgical like medical practices to enhance a client's body with technical
prosthetics called cyberware.

Many ripperdocs operate legally within the city, however in Worcester's south end as well as near the Worcester
Institute of Technology campus, there are major areas of illegal ripperdocs able to perform underground installations
for cheaper, or more dangerous and powerful installations for those willing to fork over the right amount of money.

In the city of Worcester, ripperdocs also serve as a major distributor of Gender Affirming Care. 
In 2077, as seen by the Cyberpunk 2077 game, the concept of transgenderism is no longer considered a taboo.
This is made further true by the access to Gender Affirming care provided by ripperdocs.
Ripperdocs are capable of providing cyberware replacements for transgender individuals, and even cisgender
individuals seeking cosmetic surgery. 
Installations such as breast implants or double mastectomies, 
vaginoplasty and phalloplasty, as well as facial feminization surgery or facial masculinization surgery, 
and hair transplants are all services provided at ripperdocs.
This ease of Gender Affirming care has stood in line with Worcester's core values of supporting the queer population
of the city.
