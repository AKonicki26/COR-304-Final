# Public Transportation

Public transportation in Worcester, like many mid-sized cities in the world of Cyberpunk, is a mix of outdated 
infrastructure and newer corporate-backed technology. 
Worcester maintains its public transport system the Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA), however 
in the 2020s population boom the system became prioritized, and rebranded the WRTA-X

The WRTA-X system includes a small number of self-driving electric buses and light rail cars that operate primarily in 
the northern end of the city. These routes are maintained by contract through private security and infrastructure 
companies, often tied to megacorporations. Due to higher corporate funding and oversight, 
the northern lines remain consistent and relatively safe.

The southern half of the city experiences inconsistent service, frequent delays, and occasional shutdowns. 
Transit stations in this region are often vandalized, with many bus stops having been turned into 
gang-controlled checkpoints. Some unofficial routes are operated by independent groups using refurbished vehicles, 
providing affordable but unregulated transit to the city’s underserved population.

Worcester also maintains a connection to Boston and New York through a Hyperloop transit line, 
though access is limited to those with proper identification or corporate clearance. 
Hyperloop terminals are heavily monitored and primarily used by corpo workers, 
leaving most Worcester citizens reliant on local systems.

Despite these limitations, public transportation remains a necessary part of city life, particularly for lower-income
residents, students, and the unaugmented workforce. 
The inequity of access between the north and south ends of Worcester reflects the city’s broader economic divide.
