# Energy

The world of Cyberpunk is powered through microwave energy, such as through the [Satwave Power Plant](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Satwave_Power_Plant).
This power source is renewable and dense, allowing for large amounts of power to be generated passively by satellites
orbiting the earth. 
Other large sources of power come from nuclear power plants, such as the [Petrochem Nuclear Power Plant](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Petrochem_Nuclear_Power_Plant)
The cybernetic implants, or cyberware, installed in many of the population is powered through a biological power system.

Worcester as a city, being more inland, does produce some of its own power, however due to not being wealthy and populous
enough as a city to justify a large microwave or nuclear power plant, it primarily outsources its energy from New York
and Boston power plants. These power plants are maintained by street gangs, giving the criminal underworld of these cities
decent influence over the [Worcester Government](../world-introduction.md#government).
