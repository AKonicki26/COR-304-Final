    "summary": "COR 304 Final Project This document will take you through the installation and running of the project. The Final Project wiki exists on a web-server locally hosted on your machine to allow for smooth page navigation. The web-server will by default run on localhost:8080. It is important that no other processes be running on this port beforehand. If you are unsure if any processes are currently running on port 8080, they are not. Running the webserver has not been tested on operating systems other than Windows. If you are using a different operating system, there may not be support to running the project web-server. Download To start, download the project as a zip file from either the clone or releases sections: Extract the .zip folder downloaded. Installing Dependencies There are two methods of installing dependencies, automatic and manual. Automated Download (Windows only) To download the dependencies automatically and start the web-server, run the install.ps1 script within the root of the project as administrator. The dotnet 8.0 download will not succeed if you do not run the installation file as administrator. Running the install file will download the dotnet 8.0 runtime, the dotnet tool docfx, and start the webserver. Manual Download Go to the dotnet 8.0 installation website. Download the version of dotnet according to your current operating system. Follow the installation instructions per your machine. Open a terminal in the root of the extracted folder and run the command dotnet tool -g update docfx. Docfx will then install itself globally on your machine. After the install, run the command docfx --serve. This will run the web-server on your machine. Accessing Website To open the website, open http://localhost:8080. This will bring you to the main introduction page. To access the rest of the content, click \"The World\" in the top navigation bar, or click the \"The World\" link at the bottom of the page."

    "title": "Energy | Cyberpunk Worcester",
    "summary": "Energy The world of Cyberpunk is powered through microwave energy, such as through the Satwave Power Plant. This power source is renewable and dense, allowing for large amounts of power to be generated passively by satellites orbiting the earth. Other large sources of power come from nuclear power plants, such as the Petrochem Nuclear Power Plant The cybernetic implants, or cyberware, installed in many of the population is powered through a biological power system. Worcester as a city, being more inland, does produce some of its own power, however due to not being wealthy and populous enough as a city to justify a large microwave or nuclear power plant, it primarily outsources its energy from New York and Boston power plants. These power plants are maintained by street gangs, giving the criminal underworld of these cities decent influence over the Worcester Government."

    "title": "Housing | Cyberpunk Worcester",
    "summary": "Housing In the world of Cyberpunk, housing reflects a person’s social class, corporate affiliation, and access to technology. Worcester, being a city divided by income and influence, shows a clear contrast in housing quality between the north and south ends of the city. In the northern sections of the city, corporate owned housing and large apartment skyscrapers house the wealthier elite of the city. These buildings are often guarded, climate-controlled, and feature internal smart systems. Access to these homes is generally restricted to mid-to-high ranking corporate employees, researchers. In the southern districts, especially around Main South and Kelley Square, are filled with overcrowded megablocks, converted warehouses, and abandoned industrial spaces that have been turned into makeshift housing. Many of these buildings lack basic utilities, and are often controlled by local gangs or community defense groups. Security is self-managed, and break-ins are common. Homelessness remains a major issue, with tent zones and stacked container housing being common throughout the city. Some nomadic groups set up temporary settlements on the outskirts of the city, where they rely on salvaged technology and communal living arrangements. As corporate real estate interests expand, student housing around the WIT campus grows sparse, increasing the student need for illegal cyberware installations performed by students. Many students will live in compact housing if they are not given housing opportunities by a corporate entity for academic merit. While legal protections for tenants technically still exist in the New United States, enforcement in Worcester is minimal, especially in the southern zones. Housing remains a privilege tied to wealth, employment, or alignment with a larger power structure."

    "title": "Ripperdocs | Cyberpunk Worcester",
    "summary": "Ripperdocs In the world of Cyberpunk, a Ripperdoc is a medical technician that serves between an overlap between surgeon, body artists, and mechanical engineers. They use surgical like medical practices to enhance a client's body with technical prosthetics called cyberware. Many ripperdocs operate legally within the city, however in Worcester's south end as well as near the Worcester Institute of Technology campus, there are major areas of illegal ripperdocs able to perform underground installations for cheaper, or more dangerous and powerful installations for those willing to fork over the right amount of money. In the city of Worcester, ripperdocs also serve as a major distributor of Gender Affirming Care. In 2077, as seen by the Cyberpunk 2077 game, the concept of transgenderism is no longer considered a taboo. This is made further true by the access to Gender Affirming care provided by ripperdocs. Ripperdocs are capable of providing cyberware replacements for transgender individuals, and even cisgender individuals seeking cosmetic surgery. Installations such as breast implants or double mastectomies, vaginoplasty and phalloplasty, as well as facial feminization surgery or facial masculinization surgery, and hair transplants are all services provided at ripperdocs. This ease of Gender Affirming care has stood in line with Worcester's core values of supporting the queer population of the city."

    "title": "Public Transportation | Cyberpunk Worcester",
    "summary": "Public Transportation Public transportation in Worcester, like many mid-sized cities in the world of Cyberpunk, is a mix of outdated infrastructure and newer corporate-backed technology. Worcester maintains its public transport system the Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA), however in the 2020s population boom the system became prioritized, and rebranded the WRTA-X The WRTA-X system includes a small number of self-driving electric buses and light rail cars that operate primarily in the northern end of the city. These routes are maintained by contract through private security and infrastructure companies, often tied to megacorporations. Due to higher corporate funding and oversight, the northern lines remain consistent and relatively safe. The southern half of the city experiences inconsistent service, frequent delays, and occasional shutdowns. Transit stations in this region are often vandalized, with many bus stops having been turned into gang-controlled checkpoints. Some unofficial routes are operated by independent groups using refurbished vehicles, providing affordable but unregulated transit to the city’s underserved population. Worcester also maintains a connection to Boston and New York through a Hyperloop transit line, though access is limited to those with proper identification or corporate clearance. Hyperloop terminals are heavily monitored and primarily used by corpo workers, leaving most Worcester citizens reliant on local systems. Despite these limitations, public transportation remains a necessary part of city life, particularly for lower-income residents, students, and the unaugmented workforce. The inequity of access between the north and south ends of Worcester reflects the city’s broader economic divide."

    "summary": "The Ghost in the Server Room — A Worcester campfire tale, told by flashlight in the undercommons of WIT. They say it happened in the winter of ‘69. Not 1969—2069. Right in the heart of the WIT campus, back when the old Quantum Systems Lab still had its original copper wiring and glitchy climate controls. You know, before the big renovation—before they sealed off the lower floors. The story goes that there was a student—no one remembers his real name, just his handle: Z0N3r. He was a gifted cybernetics major, top of his class, obsessed with pushing the limits of brain-machine interfacing. People said he had a custom rig hooked directly into his limbic system, allowing him to code while he slept. Or dreamed. Or both. He worked down in the old server sublevels, experimenting with illegal firmware mods and neural latency shaving—stuff even the ripperdocs warned him about. They say he started disappearing for days at a time. When he showed up, he’d barely speak. His eyes flickered like corrupted HUD overlays. One night, campus security picked up a distress ping from the basement lab. By the time they arrived, all the lights were out, and the system’s internal cameras had been wiped clean. The only footage that survived was a single frame: a blurry image of Z0N3r, hunched over a terminal, bleeding from the nose, mouth... and eyes. He’d hardwired himself into the campus AI grid. Not just interfacing—merging. They shut everything down. Scrambled his implant. They said he died instantly. But every year since then, around the winter finals, students in the basement labs report strange things: terminals turning on by themselves. System logs that rewrite themselves with corrupted code. And sometimes—if you’re alone down there late at night—you’ll hear keys clicking behind you, even if you’re the only one in the lab. Some say his ghost lives in the mainframe now. That he's still trying to finish his last project. Others say he’s watching, waiting for a student smart enough—or dumb enough—to pick up where he left off. So hey… if you’re ever pulling an all-nighter in the lower labs, and you hear a whisper that isn’t yours? Don’t turn around. Just log out."

    "summary": "[WORCESTER DAILY GRIDWIRE] – March 14, 2077 “No Sub, No Save”: Protest Erupts After Local Resident Dies Following Trauma Team Refusal WORCESTER, MA – Hundreds gathered outside the Union Station Trauma Team depot last night after reports that Janelle Ruiz, a 33-year-old resident of Main South, died in her apartment after being denied emergency medical assistance by Trauma Team International due to lack of subscription coverage. According to eyewitnesses and security footage shared online, Ruiz suffered a critical reaction to a cyberware rejection flare-up. Neighbors attempted to stabilize her while placing emergency calls, but no authorized responders arrived until over 40 minutes later—well past the critical window. By then, she had succumbed to her injuries. Trauma Team issued a formal statement this morning, reiterating that non-subscribers are not eligible for dispatch and that “protocol was followed without deviation.” “We’re not asking for miracles,” said protest organizer Amira Sanchez, shouting through an old-world bullhorn. “We’re asking for basic care. No one should die just because they can’t afford a subscription.” The crowd—largely composed of Main South residents, med-tech students from WIT, and community activists—held signs reading “No Sub, No Save = No Soul” and “We Are Not Clients. We Are People.” Police drones hovered overhead, though no violence was reported as of press time. City Councilor Luis Mendoza has called for a formal review of Worcester’s public health infrastructure and questioned the city’s continued tax subsidies for Trauma Team operations. “If they won’t respond to our people, why are they being funded by our taxes?” Mendoza stated on the floor of City Hall. Trauma Team declined further comment. As Worcester continues to straddle the line between corporate control and community survival, the death of Janelle Ruiz has reignited a long-simmering debate: Is healthcare a right—or just another subscription service?"

    "summary": "[NORTHEAST CIVIC REPORT] – June 3, 2048 Worcester to Resume Local Elections Following 18-Year Suspension WORCESTER, NUSA – In a surprise statement issued late Monday evening, the City Council of Worcester confirmed that municipal elections will be reinstated this fall, marking the first democratic process held in the city since 2030. The decision comes after sustained public pressure from community organizers, student groups, and regional governance advocates. While no formal protest or civil unrest was recorded in the city’s recent history, increased civic mobilization and renewed attention from northeastern political monitors prompted the council to act. “The Council has heard the voices of our citizens,” said acting City Manager Rebecca Qian in a pre-recorded announcement released via the Northeast CivicNet. “After careful consideration and consultation with the Office of Federal Stability, we are prepared to transition back into scheduled electoral operations.” Local elections were indefinitely suspended under Executive Directive 17-B, signed during the administration of President Elizabeth Kress, who held control over the New United States through a period of heightened corporate instability and civil unrest. At the time, Worcester was deemed a “stability-sensitive zone”, a designation which allowed the city’s existing council members to remain in office without term limits. Though the measure was originally justified by logistical concerns and the need for experienced local governance amid population shifts, critics argued that it stifled civic engagement and left residents without meaningful representation. “This is a critical step toward restoring accountability,” said Dr. Kavon Ellis, political science professor at Worcester Institute of Technology. “Worcester has remained relatively calm through turbulent decades, but civic silence is not civic peace.” The upcoming elections, scheduled for November 2048, will include positions for City Council, with internal selection of a City Manager to follow. The role of Mayor, a symbolic figurehead in Worcester’s Plan E system, will also be ceremonially confirmed. Voter registration drives are already underway, primarily led by independent student coalitions and local housing associations. However, concerns remain about voter access in the southern districts, where digital infrastructure remains underfunded. As Worcester moves toward electoral normalization, federal observers and private governance contractors are expected to monitor the process closely. The decision marks a rare return to democratic processes in a region where centralized control has become the norm. “We don’t just want elections,” said resident Marisol Vega, a community organizer in Main South. “We want change. And we want it to matter.” Whether this marks a lasting shift in local governance—or simply a temporary concession—remains to be seen."

    "title": "Worcester Massachusetts, 2077 | Cyberpunk Worcester",
    "summary": "Worcester Massachusetts, 2077 Worcester, 2025 History Due to internal corruption and divisiveness within the Northeast territories after a U.S. civilian government control, the population of the Northeast territories has been rapidly declining. New York and the Boston Metropolitan area saw a rapid decline in the populations, especially due to unregulated oil spilling. Due to not wanting to populate the coastal cities, Worcester saw a large boom in population from people evacuating New York City and Boston Metropolis without being able to migrate far. Because the poorer population from both cities were the predominant grouping moving into Worcester, it saw a large increase in street violence, drug and alcohol abuse, and homelessness within the southern districts of the city. While Worcester did not become a major metropolitan area, it did retain its status as a major city in the New England Territories. The city retained its large dichotomy between its north and south ends, with the north end being for larger corporate business, skyscrapers, and industrialization, and the south end being overrun with gang violence and illegal activity. Geography Worcester is located in central Massachusetts, New United States of America. It is the County Seat of Worcester County. Locationally, it is overshadowed by the Boston Metropolis. Demographics As said in the project introduction, Worcester houses a near 50% White population, with a large portion of the remaining half of the city's population being either Black or Latino as of July 2023. As well, 76.6% of people speak another language besides English. Due to population trends over the past decade, it is expected that the amount of racial minorities will continue to grow by the year 2077. The same situation can be found with the queer population of Worcester. As of 2025, an estimated 5% of the Worcester population identifies within the LTBTQ+ community. However, the percentage of people identifying as queer is increasing \\with 28% of people ages 18-24 identifying themselves as queer. Assuming these trends continue with an inevitable plateau, it could be assumed Worcester will sustain a queer population in its future, especially with the leftist support the city has. Economy The world of Cyberpunk uses a currency known as the \"European Currency Unit,\" commonly referred to as the \"Eurodollar\" for short. This is the main central currency of both Europe and North America. The New United States has continued to maintain the U.S. dollar, which has now depreciated in value with the use of holographic currency.The U.S. Dollar only has about half the spending power of the Eurodollar. Government The New United States retained its three branch government. Worcester also maintains its Plan-E governing system, electing both a City Council and a City Manager elected by the council. The Mayor of Worcester exists predominantly as a symbolic figure, however they do oversee the City Council's activities. During the 2020s, under the dictatorial Presidency of Elizabeth Kress, Worcester did not hold new elections for City Council. This opened up a larger weakness through the city as the larger migration of people from the New York City and Boston areas occured, however due to the experience of the members on the council at the time, the corruption of the City Council did not prove to be a large threat, only exposing to a short term corruption concern. Worcester returned to its regular election schedule in 2048, slightly before the resignation of Elizabeth Kress, due largely in part due to protests within the city for new leadership. Education Education is an important facet of Worcester Life. Worcester Polytechnic Institute (later rebranded to Worcester Institute of Technology (WIT) to advertise their more hands on research driven program) became a dominant school for young New Englander's in the 2010s. The school saw a small drop in attendance due to the danger associated with living in the City throughout the 2020s. WIT would reblossom into a highly regarded school for corporate Ripperdocs to graduate from, however the school population would also be known for performing underground cyberware operations off campus for extra practice. This resulted in a small population of cyberjunkies who will remain near WIT campus looking for their next installation. Several companies in the northern end of Worcester also sponsor prestigious vocational schools and colleges, preparing teens and young adults to be able to enter the corporate world soon after their graduation."

    "summary": "Introduction This webpage exists to document a fictional version of the city Worcester, Massachusetts as if it existed in the time period of the Cyberpunk setting created by Mike Pondsmith. All credit of the Cyberpunk world goes to Mike Pondsmith, CD Projekt Red, and all parties responsible for maintaining and adding to the Cyberpunk setting. It should also be assumed that unless a source is linked referencing a specific aspect of Worcester life or the Cyberpunk setting, that the statements made are not factual. They will be presented as they are factual, but this is for creative writing purposes. Please do not take anything in this document as official factual data on the world of Cyberpunk or the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. Worcester Today Worcester in the year 2025 is the second-largest city in all the New England region. The city houses an estimated 207,621 people as of July 1st, 2023. About 50% of the city is White, with the 2nd and 3rd largest demographics being Latino and Black respectively. This makes Worcester a fairly diverse city racially. Worcester is also known for being a sanctuary city for LGTBQ+ individuals, especially those under the transgender umbrella. Aligning with these core ideals of Worcester, it is a city that is relatively progressive leaning politically. This will be important information to keep in mind moving forward throughout the rest of this document. The Cyberpunk Setting The Cyberpunk Setting predominantly takes place in the fictional city of Night City, California in the year of 2077. Night City features major themes of political and corporate corruption, homelessness, drug and substance abuse, and illegal gang activity. Two major companies, Arasaka and Militech, use their corporate power to enact whatever policies they want upon the people of Night City with zero repercussions. This can be especially shown through privatized healthcare companies such as Trauma Team. Trauma Team as a company has shown to be a subscription based healthcare company similar to today's private insurance companies, however due to advancements in technology they are able to arrive at a scene within minutes of automated detection of a client injury. However, instead of acting like more modern healthcare companies evacuating all that need assistance from an emergency situation, they will only protect their clientele, leaving anyone without a subscription to Trauma Team to die. If you wish to research the setting of Cyberpunk more, see the Cyberpunk Fandom Wiki. Project motivations Seeing the large scale corporate and political greed in the Cyberpunk setting of Night City contrast with the political ideals of Worcester, MA made me want to image a setting of Worcester in the year 2077 should the Cyberpunk setting come to fruition. This imaginary Worcester will take direct inspiration from the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Netflix show and the Cyberpunk: 2077 video game developed by CD Projekt Red. The ideals of Worcester in 2025 will be assumed to be held in the future, taking a modern day Worcester and maintaining its ideals as technology progresses.
