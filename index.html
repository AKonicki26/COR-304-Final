<p>This webpage exists to document a fictional version of the city Worcester, Massachusetts as if it existed in the time
period of the Cyberpunk setting created by Mike Pondsmith. All credit of the Cyberpunk world goes to Mike Pondsmith,
CD Projekt Red, and all parties responsible for maintaining and adding to the Cyberpunk setting.</p>
<p>It should also be assumed that unless a source is linked referencing a specific aspect of Worcester life or the Cyberpunk
setting, that the statements made are not factual. They will be presented as they are factual, but this is for
creative writing purposes. Please do not take anything in this document as official factual data on the world
of Cyberpunk or the city of Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>

<h2 id="worcester-today">Worcester Today</h2>
<p>Worcester in the year 2025 is the second-largest city in all the New England region. The city houses an estimated
207,621 people as of July 1st, 2023. About 50% of the city is White, with the 2nd and 3rd largest demographics being
Latino and Black respectively. This makes Worcester a fairly diverse city racially.</p>
<p>Worcester is also known for being a sanctuary city for LGTBQ+ individuals, especially those under the
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/02/13/worcester-resolution-transgender-sanctuary-city">transgender umbrella</a>.</p>
<p>Aligning with these core ideals of Worcester, it is a city that is relatively progressive leaning politically.
This will be important information to keep in mind moving forward throughout the rest of this document.</p>

<h2 id="the-cyberpunk-setting">The Cyberpunk Setting</h2>
<p>The Cyberpunk Setting predominantly takes place in the fictional city of Night City, California in the year of 2077.
Night City features major themes of political and corporate corruption, homelessness, drug and substance abuse,
and illegal gang activity.</p>
<p>Two major companies, Arasaka and Militech, use their corporate power to enact whatever policies they want upon the
people of Night City with zero repercussions. This can be especially shown through privatized healthcare companies such
as Trauma Team.</p>
<p>Trauma Team as a company has shown to be a subscription based healthcare company similar to today's
private insurance companies, however due to advancements in technology they are able to arrive at a scene within minutes of
automated detection of a client injury. However, instead of acting like more modern healthcare companies evacuating all
that need assistance from an emergency situation, they will only protect their clientele, leaving anyone without
a subscription to Trauma Team to die.</p>
<p>If you wish to research the setting of Cyberpunk more, see the <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberpunk_Wiki">Cyberpunk Fandom Wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="project-motivations">Project motivations</h2>
<p>Seeing the large scale corporate and political greed in the Cyberpunk setting of Night City contrast with the political
ideals of Worcester, MA made me want to image a setting of Worcester in the year 2077 should the Cyberpunk setting come
to fruition. This imaginary Worcester will take direct inspiration from the <strong>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</strong> Netflix show and
the <strong>Cyberpunk: 2077</strong> video game developed by CD Projekt Red. The ideals of Worcester in 2025 will be assumed to be
held in the future, taking a modern day Worcester and maintaining its ideals as technology progresses.</p>
