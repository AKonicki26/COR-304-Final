<p><em>— A Worcester campfire tale, told by flashlight in the undercommons of WIT.</em></p>
<p>They say it happened in the winter of ‘69.<br>
Not <em>1969</em>—<strong>2069</strong>.</p>
<p>Right in the heart of the WIT campus, back when the old Quantum Systems Lab still had its original copper wiring
and glitchy climate controls. You know, before the big renovation—before they sealed off the lower floors.</p>
<p>The story goes that there was a student—no one remembers his real name, just his handle: <strong>Z0N3r</strong>.
He was a gifted cybernetics major, top of his class, obsessed with pushing the limits of brain-machine interfacing.
People said he had a custom rig hooked directly into his limbic system, allowing him to code while he slept. Or dreamed.
Or both.</p>
<p>He worked down in the old server sublevels, experimenting with illegal firmware mods and neural latency shaving—stuff
even the ripperdocs warned him about. They say he started disappearing for days at a time.
When he showed up, he’d barely speak. His eyes flickered like corrupted HUD overlays.</p>
<p>One night, campus security picked up a distress ping from the basement lab. By the time they arrived,
<strong>all the lights were out</strong>, and the system’s internal cameras had been wiped clean.
The only footage that survived was a single frame: a blurry image of Z0N3r, hunched over a terminal,
bleeding from the nose, mouth... and eyes.</p>
<p>He’d hardwired himself into the campus AI grid. Not just interfacing—<strong>merging</strong>.</p>
<p>They shut everything down. Scrambled his implant. <br>
They said he died instantly.</p>
<p>But every year since then, around the winter finals, students in the basement labs report strange things:
terminals turning on by themselves. System logs that rewrite themselves with corrupted code.
And sometimes—if you’re alone down there late at night—you’ll hear keys clicking behind you,
even if you’re the only one in the lab.</p>
<p>Some say his ghost lives in the mainframe now. That he's still trying to finish his last project.
Others say he’s watching, waiting for a student smart enough—or dumb enough—to pick up where he left off.</p>
<p>So hey… if you’re ever pulling an all-nighter in the lower labs, and you hear a whisper that isn’t yours?</p>
<p><strong>Don’t turn around. Just log out.</strong></p>
